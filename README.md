## 🛠️ **Browser-Based Sandbox for Building GPT Apps**

**“Zapier for AI workflows” — no code required.**

---

### 💡 **Core Idea**

Create a **drag-and-drop web platform** where users can build mini-apps using GPT (or other LLMs) without writing a single line of code.

Instead of learning APIs or coding, users can **chain together prebuilt blocks** like:

- **Text input → GPT prompt → Formatter → Output**
- **Form submission → File upload → LLM summarizer → Email sender**
- **Scrape a URL → Ask GPT to extract insights → Save to Notion**

---

### 🧱 **Key Features**

- **Node/block-based UI** (like Bubble or Node-RED)
- **Prompt editor** with live test results
- **Variables and chaining** (pass user inputs into GPT)
- **Built-in deploy** to share apps instantly (like a mini Webflow)
- **Templates gallery** (e.g., resume improver, customer support reply generator, product description writer)

---

### 💡 Example Use Cases

- "Generate blog titles from keywords"
- "ChatGPT-powered lead qualifier form"
- "Summarize a Zoom transcript into a to-do list"
- "Client questionnaire → proposal draft"

---

### 🤖 AI Stack (MVP)

- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 or open-source via API (e.g., Claude, Mistral, Ollama)
- **NLP Plugins**: Add-ons like OCR, web scraping, or translation
- **Data storage**: LocalStorage for MVP, Firebase or Supabase for scale

---

### 🧪 MVP Validation Plan

1. **Niche down** to freelancers, marketers, or recruiters
2. Share demos on:

   - Reddit: r/ChatGPTDev, r/SideProject, r/PromptEngineering
   - Discord: AI Builder or GPT communities
   - Indie Hackers + Product Hunt

3. Offer prebuilt flows with copy/paste deploy links
4. Add pricing tiers after validating value

---

### 🏷️ Monetization Ideas

- **Free tier**: Limited flows & GPT usage
- **Pro plan**: Unlimited workflows, API integrations, custom branding
- **Team tier**: Shared flows, collaboration, analytics

---

### ⚡ Similar tools (but still early-stage or code-heavy)

- **Flowise** – open-source LLM app builder (technical users)
- **Pico** – chat app builder (chat-focused only)
- **Zapier AI** – still in early AI experimentation phase
- **Replit Ghostwriter Agents** – dev-focused
